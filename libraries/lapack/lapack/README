BUILDING THE LIBRARY
--------------------

To create the library go to directory src and give commands

make cleanall
make

This should create file liblapack.a in that directory.

USING THE LIBRARY
-----------------

To use the library in your programs use the compilation command like

gfortran -o myprog myprog.f90 -llapack -L/path/to/library/directory

When using the library in C programs (at least with gcc) you should
compile the program with gfortran:

gfortran -o myprog myprog.c -llapack -L/path/to/library/directory

(This is because LAPACK built by gfortran uses some fortran libraries
and they are automatically linked when using gfortran to compile the
code. On the other hand, to compile the C code gfortran notices that
the source is in C and processes it using the C front-end.)

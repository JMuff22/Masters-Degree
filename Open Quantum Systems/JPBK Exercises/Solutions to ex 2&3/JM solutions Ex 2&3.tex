\begin{enumerate}

\item Problem 2.1. Obtain heat in a nearly quasi-static drive in a two level system.
%Question 1 Answer here
\\
This question troubled me, in particular, the meaning behind "nearly quasi-static". I'm not sure what this means as a quasi-static process is one in which it is almost or nearly static or stationary so the term "nearly" here doesn't seem to have any meaning. 
I read the paper \cite{4}, mentioning quasistatic drive and I will assume that you wish us to study the Quasistatic limit in which $W$ is close to the ideal limit of $-K_B T ln(2)$ or the case where there is equality $W = Q$ 
\\
\\
There is also the case from where the Hamiltonian simply reads  \cite{10}
$$ H = E_C (n-n_g )^2 $$
For a single electron box where $E_C = \frac{e^2}{2C}$. The cited paper mentions 'sweeping' out the quasi-static drive to $n_g = 1/2$ allowing for the increase in the entropy of the charge system giving 
$$ \Delta S = K_B ln(2) $$ 
And due to the process being quasi-static, $\Delta S$ is equal to the increase in the entropy of the bath so
$$ \Delta Q = T \Delta S = K_B T ln(2) $$ 
Maxwell's demon allows the system to be a "nearly" quasistatic driven system as the degeneracy can be 'ramped', turning the process cyclic and extracting heat of $K_B T ln(2) $ from the bath. Experimentally, Jukka finds that the average heat dissapated is 
$$ Q_{avg} = -0.75 K_B T ln(2) $$ 

%On the other hand, not taking into account the lecture notes or supplementary material I considered a standard two-level system between a small open system and a heat reservoir in which the energy of the system can be related to the first law of thermodyanmics 


\item Problem 2.2: Proof of Landauer's Principle
\\
Consider a two level system with thermodynamic entropy $K_B ln(2)$, which was proven by Von Neumann in 1949. The process of the erasure of the bit gives us a starting point of a microstate where the entropy is zero. \\
According to the 2nd law of thermodynamics, entropy cannot decrease - it must go somewhere-, so it is 'transferred' to the environment with temperature $T$ giving us an energy cost of atleast $K_B T ln(2)$ so 
$$ E \geq K_B T ln(2) $$
This is a very simple version where the proof as laid out by Von Neumann was not explicitely stated. Thermodynamic entropy cannot be so easily related to the information entropy. 
Jukka Pekola wrote a very interesting paper [3] which related the reversal to Maxwell's limit of thermodynamic efficiency and shows that it is consistent with the 2nd law of thermodynamics. 
\\
A more rigourous mathematical proof is the following: 
\\
The work extracted during isothermal quasistatic expansion is given by 
$$ \Delta Q = \Delta W = \int_{\frac{V}{2}}^V \rho dV $$
$$ = \int_{\frac{V}{2}}^V \frac{K_B T}{V} dV $$ 
$$ = K_B T ln(2) $$ 
The second law of thermodyanmics states that the entropy of an isolated system can never decrease with time. Applying this to the above fixes $\Delta Q$ 
$$ \Delta Q \geq K_B T ln(2) $$
$$ E \geq K_B T ln(2) $$
This can also be proven from isothermal compression as well 
$$ \Delta Q = - \Delta W $$ 
$$ = - \int_{v}^{\frac{V}{2}} \rho dV = - \int_{V}^{\frac{V}{2}} \frac{K_B T}{V} dV $$
$$ = K_b T ln(2) $$




\item Problem 3.1.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Why CBT in the universal regime where $ E_C << K_B T $ can be considered a primary thermometer? 
    \\
    In a 'Primary' thermometer the measuredd property of matter is known so well that temperature can be calculated without any unknown quantities. Which is CBT we have 
    $$ \frac{G}{G_T} = 1 - \frac{2E_C}{K_B T} g \big( \frac{eV}{2K_B T}\Big) $$ 
    $$ g(x) = \frac{x sinh(x) - 4sinh^2 (x/2)}{8sinh^4 (x/2)} $$
    So 
    $$ \frac{G}{G_T} = 1 - \frac{e^2/C}{K_B T} \frac{ xsinh(x) - 4sinh^2 (x/2)}{8sinh^4 (x/2)} $$
    Where 
    $$ x = \frac{eV}{2 K_B T} $$
    And for $N=2$ case 
    $$ E_C = \frac{e^2}{2C} $$ 
    In the case where $E_C << K_B T$ the normalized conductance does not depend on the CBT's dimensions and can be considered a primary thermometer (As $2E_c / K_B T \rightarrow 0$)
    \item If we consider the full width half minimum of the normalized conductance so $V = V_{1/2}$ and set this to $\lambda$ 
    $$ \frac{eV_{1/2}}{N K_B T} = \lambda $$
    $$ V_{1/2} = \frac{\lambda N K_B T}{e}$$
    The numerical number was calculated to be 
    $$ \lambda = 5.434 $$

\section{Note}
I found these exercises particularly hard, mainly due to the nature of the questions, however I believe this was due to getting use to the particular thermodynamic jargon used of which I am not used to. I found an abundance of papers and research completed online (mostly by Jukka Pekola) which taught me a great deal and helped supplement what was taught in the lectures, however did not help me to complete the questions theoretically. I have attached references in my bibliography at the bottom to works which I heavily relied on.

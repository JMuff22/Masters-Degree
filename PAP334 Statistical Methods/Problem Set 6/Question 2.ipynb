    "For this question I simply used the equations given in the question/lecture notes. As the tbale is small I inputted the data manually. The degrees of freedom between the samples was calculated from (r-1)=2 as the number of samples was 3. The degrees of freedom within the samples is N-3=267. The P value was calculated from the online applet linked below. "
